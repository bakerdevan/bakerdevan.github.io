									<p>With the power of Google and several other search engines, it is now more possible than ever to locate information. And for most reasons, this is a huge advantage, but when it comes to personal security, this can be very disadvantageous for some. We have to be very careful about the information we post about ourselves online. With the adaptive learning systems of these complex search engines, it can make several inferences about you and your private information. For example, most people know Google collects information about your searches and interests, but did you know you could see what Google knows about you? <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-does-google-know-about-me-search-history-delete-2019-10" target="_blank">Click on this link</a> to read about how you can see what kind of information Google already knows about you. You will be impressed by how much information Google has collected about you.</p>
									<p>However, Google and the other cloud-based services only know what you provide them with. Limiting the information you are willing to provide to these websites will keep your information from going viral. You would not go up to a stranger on the sidewalk and provide him with very personal information, would you? But interestingly enough, not only can these actions put your personal information in jeopardy, but you could be giving a potential burglar the key to your house. Literally! The trend of posting photos of a key to your new home could lead you into some trouble. There have been reports of individuals posting photos of keys to their new home, only to be broken into afterward. Why? Because skilled individuals can recreate your key simply off the photo you GAVE them! <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/house-key-photos-36846411" target="_blank">This link</a> from Apartment Therapy provides more information about the issue at hand.</p>

								<h2>Computer Security</h2>
									<p>When it comes to securing your computer, there are countless methods, features, and settings you could alter to lock up your information. But none of those things are important if you don't have a password on your computer itself. Having a strong password on the computer itself is imperative to the protection of your information. Individuals who use laptops in a public setting may have to leave their computers attended at times, and without a password, your information could be up for grabs. Not only that, but if someone broke into your home or stole your laptop out of your bag, you might have lost your laptop but your information would still be protected. These days, we have been provided with additional means of logging into a computer, mostly to increase ease. You can use PINs, fingerprints, and even facial recognition. While sometimes these options may not be always reliable, they are still more secure than no password at all.</p>

									<p>No matter the type of computer you use, the computer will give you those pesky update messages. However, before you quickly dismiss them and push the updates off to the side, maybe consider the reason this update is being released. The majority of updates usually are security updates. Have you ever read through a windows security update changelog? I know it sounds boring, but typically there are lots of changes and it discusses security leaks and vulnerabilities that have been fixed. Just think, without the update you would be vulnerable to these exploits, and your information could be in jeopardy!</p>

									<p>Most people do not realize the usefulness of anti-virus software. Before you wave off downloading anti-virus software, you should read up on the advantages of using one. Windows comes with Windows Defender, a factory-installed set of defenses, however, hackers and exploiters have become advanced and Windows Defender may not always be able to perform the job. Having a separately installed anti-virus software may be beneficial to you to protect your information. These software are managed by companies specifically designed at protecting information and computers from exploits and vulnerabilities. So why wouldn't you want to be preventive and stop someone from having access to your information?</p>
									<h3>Click the image below to view some reasons why free, and even paid, anti-virus software is worth it!</h3>

								<h2>Mobile Security</h2>
									<p>Similar to a desktop computer, your phone will often have updates. These updates are just as important, if not more important, than your computer's updates. In today's day and age, we are more inclined to utilize our cell phones rather than other electronics. Therefore, they are also more likely to be exploited and vulnerable to attackers. That is why it is important to stay up to date on security and feature patches on your phone so you are protected from new attacks that are developed.</p>
									<span class="image main"><center><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/26/eb/e3/26ebe3d43d5af9a57ae35a7492a6fac9.gif" alt="" style="width:75%;" /></center></span>
									<p>Although it may be tempting to use the neighbor's WiFi, you may want to think twice about doing so. Remember, all the websites and information you exchange through the network could be intercepted by the owner of the network. Although you may trust your neighbor, you do not know if their network is compromised and being monitored by hackers or attacks. Utilizing your own network with properly configured security settings is more optimal for the safety of your information.</p>

									<p>When you are in public, you might want to look into utilizing a Virtual Private Network (or VPN) application. VPN software safeguards your data by masking your device's IP address, encrypting it, and routing it through secure networks to servers in distant states or even other countries. As a result, it conceals your online identity, allowing you to browse the Internet safely and anonymously. Several VPNs are free but may have some limits on the amount of data transmitted or other limits. However, the cost of a paid VPN may be worth it when protecting your information from possible leaks and vulnerabilities, leaving you vulnerable to identity theft.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Internet Security</h2>
									<p>When surfing the internet, you probably don't pay attention to the URL in the search bar. But, maybe you should. When on websites handling sensitive information, including passwords and personal identifiers, you most likely cross your fingers and trust they will protect your information. But, most current web browsers have a few methods of showing if the website is secure! For example, if you are on a website and the URL starts with "https://" instead of "http://" the website is encrypted. This means the website is securing your information as it's exchanged between your computer and their servers. Some newer browsers, specifically Google Chrome, have made it even simpler and display a lock icon on the left side of the URL if the website is secured. You can click on the lock, or the informational button, to read about the website's security and connection. Try a couple of your favorite websites and see if they're secure!</p>
									<span class="image main"><center><img src="https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/security/files/2020/11/upgrade-v4-1.gif" alt="" style="width:75%;" /></center></span>
									<p>While looking for information or just visiting your favorite websites, you may be curious about where a link may be taking you. Believe it or not, on a Windows Desktop, you can see where this link will take you. You can hover over the link, and in the bottom left corner, it will display the URL for the link. Another method would be to right-click on the link and copy the link. You could then paste the link into the word document or another safe location to view the link before following it.</p>
									<p>When it comes to emails, I'm sure we all have the same experience. Amongst the emails we want to receive, there are also several unsolicited emails and you're unsure if they are real. While this can sometimes take some time to investigate and determine, there are some very simple ways to rule out fake emails. Visit <a href="https://cheapsslsecurity.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-an-email-is-fake-or-real/" target="_blank">this link</a> to get insight on how to rule out these emails and keep your information safe!</p>

									<p>Many of us make the same mistake of utilizing the same password for each website and device. Although securing a device with a password does stop people from accessing your information, unfortunately, if they figure out that password, they now have access to all of your devices and accounts. Likewise, if you were to establish different passwords for websites, they would only be able to access the website with the one password they discovered. There are several types of software and tools you can utilize to manage your passwords in case you have too many to remember.</p>
